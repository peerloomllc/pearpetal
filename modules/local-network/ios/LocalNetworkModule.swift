// Forces the iOS Local Network permission prompt.
//
// iOS only surfaces the Local Network prompt (and the per-app toggle under
// Settings) the first time an app actually touches the LAN: Bonjour, multicast,
// or a direct connection to a same-subnet address. PearPetal's transport is
// Hyperswarm/hyperdht running inside the Bare worklet, which reaches peers via
// the DHT + UDP holepunch and, on first launch, may never attempt a direct
// same-subnet connection - so the prompt never fires and same-WiFi peers fall
// back to the slower relayed path. This module nudges the OS by advertising and
// browsing a throwaway Bonjour service (`_pearpetallan._tcp`, declared in
// NSBonjourServices), which makes iOS evaluate LAN access and present the
// prompt. Once the user grants it, the whole app process (including the Bare
// sockets) is allowed to reach LAN peers directly.
